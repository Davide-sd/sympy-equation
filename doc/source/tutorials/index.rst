Tutorials
---------

Here are some tutorials to explain what this module can accomplish.

In particular, **Overview** (the first tutorial) is an introduction to
the ``Equation`` class.

The other tutorials are going to showcase the *expression manipulation*
capabilities offered by this module. Remember that the intent of this module
is to allow using the mathematical tools in SymPy to rearrange equations and
perform algebra in a stepwise fashion using as close to standard mathematical
notation as possible. Please, note that when it comes to expression
manipulation, there are many ways to achieve the same end results.
When following these tutorials, take the necessary time to think about how
you would achieve the same results using plain SymPy, then compare the
two approaches in order to appreaciate the differences and understand
when it makes sense to use plain SymPy, and when it make sense to use
the capabilities offered by this module.
