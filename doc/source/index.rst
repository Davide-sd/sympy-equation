Welcome to sympy_equation's documentation!
==========================================

``sympy_equation`` defines relations that all high school and college students
would recognize as mathematical equations, consisting of a left hand side (lhs)
and a right hand side (rhs) connected by the relation operator "=". This is
implemented by the ``Equation`` class, which also supports mathematical
operations applied to both sides simultaneously, just as students are taught
to do when  attempting to isolate (solve for) a variable. Thus the statement
``Equation/b`` yields a new equation ``Equation.lhs/b = Equation.rhs/b``.

The intent is to allow using the mathematical tools in `SymPy <https://docs.sympy.org/latest/index.html>`_
to rearrange equations and perform algebra in a stepwise fashion using as
close to standard mathematical notation as  possible. In this way more people
can successfully perform  algebraic rearrangements without stumbling over
missed details such as a negative sign.

A simple example as it would appear in a `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org>`_
notebook is shown immediately below:

In IPython environments (IPython, Jupyter, Google  Colab, etc...) there is
also a shorthand syntax for entering equations provided through the IPython
preparser. An equation can be specified as ``eq1 =@ a/b = c/d``.

The ``=@`` symbol combination was chosen to avoid conflicts with reserved
python symbols while minimizing impacts on syntax highlighting and
autoformatting.


Development and Support
=======================

If you feel like a feature could be implemented, open an
`issue or create a PR <https://github.com/Davide-sd/sympy_equation/issues>`_.
Implementing new features and fixing bugs requires time and energy too.
